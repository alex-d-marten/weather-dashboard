# weather-dashboard

## Description
This repository contains JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that together form a working weather dashboard. This dashboard utilizes the OpenWeather free weather API and the OpenWeather geocoding API to provide the current weather conditions given a user search input. Initially the page displays a search field which requires at minimum a city string. Once a City has been entered, the current weather conditions for the day are displayed indicating an icon representative of the current weather conditions, the temperature, wind speed, humidity and current UV Index. Additionally, a 5-day forecast is displayed below the current conditions indicating the an icon of the predicted weather conditions, the temperature, wind speed, and humidity. Lastly, the search is stored in the search history and displayed beneat the search bar as a quick link which can be clicked to display that previous search's weather conditions. Upon page refreshes the search history will persist.
